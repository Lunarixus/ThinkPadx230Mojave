# ThinkPadx230Mojave
Clover EFI setup for Mojave on the ThinkPad x230

# Setup
Setup is easy, just replace the stock EFI folder with this one

# My specs
- i5 3320M
- 8GB of RAM
- 320GB HDD
- "Lenovo" Atheros AR9285

# Anything else
Stock WiFi on the ThinkPad x230 will NOT work as it's an Intel card which isn't supported under macOS.
You can get the same WiFi card I have here: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Lenovo-Wlan-card-AR9285-AR5B95-PCI-E-mini-Card-V1-1/232470282992?hash=item36204f02f0:g:-mQAAOSwLpdW93yW:rk:2:pf:1
This card doesn't require you to flash your BIOS, thank me later.
I'll try to update this repo with every release but there will only be minor changes.

# Credits
I can't put all of you here but you know who you are and I'd like to say a big thanks to all of you.
